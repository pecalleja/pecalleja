## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Python developer with more than 6 years of experience working in backend applications and tooling. I have a solid background in telecommunications systems and extensive experience in IT operations across different industries and Cloud Service Providers. I possess a wide range of skills and I can be very versatile. I am interested in topics like design patterns, software architecture, and large-scale applications.
I am enthusiastic and like to work on new projects that put my skills to the test. I love studying and learning new things. My core values are transparency and commitment to getting things done.
