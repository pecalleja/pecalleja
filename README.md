## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python developer with over six years of experience building backend applications and tooling. I've got a solid background in telecom systems and plenty of experience in IT operations across different industries and cloud providers. My skills are pretty broad, so I can adapt to whatever comes my way.
I'm always excited to dive into new projects that push my limits. I love learning and keeping up with the latest tech. For me, transparency and getting things done are what it's all about.
